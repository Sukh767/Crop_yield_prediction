# CROP YIELD PREDICTOR🌱
Yield Prediction in India using Decision Tree Regressor
This project implements a machine learning model to predict crop yield in India using a Decision Tree Regressor.
Objective:

Develop a model to predict crop yield based on various factors like state, crop type, temperature, and rainfall data.
Data:

The model utilizes a dataset containing historical data on crop yield, state, crop type, crop season temperature, and rainfall information for various regions in India.
Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Encode categorical variables like state and crop type.
Feature Engineering:
Analyze correlations between features and yield to identify the most impactful factors.
Consider creating additional features based on domain knowledge.
Model Training:
Train a Decision Tree Regressor model on the prepared data.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal prediction accuracy.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
Consider implementing cross-validation for robust evaluation.
Prediction:
Allow users to input state, crop type, temperature, and rainfall data to predict the yield for a specific scenario.
Benefits:

Farmers can leverage this tool to make informed decisions about crop selection, resource allocation, and potential risks based on predicted yields.
Government agencies can utilize the model for yield forecasting and agricultural planning purposes.
Project Structure:

The project repository will likely include:
Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
The trained Decision Tree Regressor model saved as a pickle file.
Readme file with clear documentation on project goals, methodology, and usage instructions.
Further Enhancements:

Explore the use of other machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or Support Vector Machines for comparison.
Integrate weather data APIs for real-time temperature and rainfall information.
Develop a user-friendly web application to facilitate yield prediction for farmers and stakeholders.
